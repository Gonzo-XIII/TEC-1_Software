Who the hell uses Tapes, anyway?! ;)

This version of JMON, editted by Mark Jelic, has the Tape Utilities stripped out and has Serial Comms routines for use with an appropriate module.

It also has new routines to make it easy to work with the LCD screen which is considered essential to get the most out of this monitor.
