## Unsorted ROMs from Talking Electronics

Alan Laughton donated these ROM images to the repository. 
```
When I visited Colin Mitchell a few years back, he gave me all the TEC-1 stuff he had.  
Thats all be scanned, imaged etc and in the repositories.  
However, there was a tube of 2732 eproms which I have only just imaged.  
No idea whats in them is TEC-1 related, 
would you like to have a look and see if there is anything of interest in them.  
2 appear to be Character Font roms.
```

So far, I've disassembled the ROMs in the simplest way possible. No consideeration has been made of origin, word alignment or data areas.
A more careful dissaembly and annotation of these ROMs needs to be conducted. 

Currently we have no idea where these ROMs came from or 
what projects they were associated with. The filenames are simply what was found on the labels of the chips. 
Half of them are unlabelled. Any light others might be able to throw on them would be appreciated. Does this ROM naming scheme ring any bells 

/bin - the original ROM images
/disassembly - a simple disassembly
