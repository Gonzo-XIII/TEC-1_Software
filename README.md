# The TEC-1 Software Repository
A repository for programs written for the TEC-1 and links to other TEC-1 software projects

### Getting started (draft, copied from a Facebook comment)
The best place to start is to read the original magazine articles that accompanied the kit in 1983. Talking Electronics was a magazine which Ken Stone and John Hardy designed the TEC-1 for publication in, the coverage starts in volume 10 and has stuff about the TEC for 6 issues.

After that you should sharpen your Z80 skills. Zaks has been already mentioned. There are plenty of good books that are available for free online although a physical paper book is still better to read. Here is the book I learned on https://archive.org/.../The_Z80_microcomputer_handbook...?

You need a ready reference of Z80 instructions.

You need access to an assembler because hand assembly is too much work. Here is an online one which I use a lot

You need an actual TEC-1 kit running a monitor program. There are a few versions: Mon 1 (which I wrote back then), Mon 2 (written by Ken Stone) and JMon (written. by Jim Robertson). Mon 1 is the ROM used by the early magazine articles, it has a few games and tunes. Mon 2 fixes some of the issues with Mon 1 and adds some useful functions for inserting code etc. JMon is the most comprehensive and contains additional features for debugging code.

You can get the source for those here although you should also be able to source a programmed EPROM. https://github.com/jhlagado/TEC-1

You can also test drive a working simulation of the TEC-1 online here. This will enable you to try programming the TEC-1 without actually having one. You can also try the different ROMs. https://jhlagado.github.io/wicked-tec1/
