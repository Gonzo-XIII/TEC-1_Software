## Observations from a n00b
Hi there! Let me introduce myself: I'm a n00b to the TEC-1, coding in assemby and not so skilled in electronic designs. But I'm an enthusiast and I'd like to share my findings struggling with the TEC-1. I use a TEC-1D, built it myself, ordered the PCB from Benn Grimmett (who gives me also technical and moral support!). So, some stuff here might be very obvious to you but wasn't for me: my apologies for that! I also have built an 8x8 matrix board and the observations are starting from there! I will update this document and add listings to the repository! Regards, Reinoud.
